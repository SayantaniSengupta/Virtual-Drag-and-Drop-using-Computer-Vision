# Virtual-Drag-and-Drop-using-Computer-Vision

This project implements a **drag-and-drop system using hand tracking**, where users can drag virtual boxes on the screen using just their fingers and a webcam — no mouse or touchpad needed!

## 🎯 Features

- Real-time hand tracking using your webcam
- Virtual rectangles that can be dragged with finger gestures
- Pinch gesture (index and middle finger) to activate drag
- Smooth and interactive UI using OpenCV
